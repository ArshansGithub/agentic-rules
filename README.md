# agentic-rules

A collection of rules and system prompts I use for AI-assisted development.

## Rules

| Rule | Model | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| [Pre-Launch Development Mode](rules/pre-launch-development-mode/) | Opus 4 (thinking, 1M tokens) | Enterprise-grade spec-driven development with strict error handling, file organization, and refactoring discipline |
| [windsurf-credit-saver](https://github.com/ArshansGithub/windsurf-credit-saver) | Opus 4.6 Thinking 1M (recommended) | Keeps Cascade sessions alive with inline questions to eliminate per-prompt charges and maximize credit efficiency |
